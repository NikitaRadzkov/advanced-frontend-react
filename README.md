# Advanced-frontend
Advanced frontend React repository

## Architectural Methodology
The project follows the Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) methodology, which is a modern and scalable approach to building large-scale applications in React. FSD is based on the principle of dividing the application into feature slices, each with its own state management, logic, and presentation.

In FSD, each feature slice has a clear boundary and can be developed and tested independently of other slices. This approach makes it easier to maintain and scale the application as it grows.

## Architecture Overview
The architecture of the project is based on the following components:

* React: A library for building user interfaces
* React Router: A library for handling routing in React applications
* SASS: A preprocessor for CSS
